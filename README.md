# Cloud Resume Backend Repository 
This repository contains code and resources for a Python-based AWS Lambda function, likely designed to perform serverless tasks in the AWS cloud environment. The main purpose of this project is to set up, deploy, and manage serverless functions with AWS Lambda, leveraging Python to handle the function's logic. The repository includes configuration files for dependencies, settings, and code management.

# Key Files and Directories
- lambda_function.py: This file contains the primary logic for the AWS Lambda function. The script defines the function handler that AWS Lambda invokes when the function is triggered. Key parts of this file typically include event handling, business logic, and response generation.
- python.gitignore: A .gitignore file tailored for Python projects. It specifies which files and directories should be excluded from version control, typically including __pycache__, virtual environment directories, and common temporary files.
